# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Work Day Scheduler is a web app that allows the user to save events for each hour of the work day (9am to 5pm). 

The current date is displayed at the top of the page and updates each day. The work hours are displayed on the left, there is an open text area in the center, and a save button on the right. When text is entered in the text area and the save button is clicked, the text is saved to local storage so that when the page is re-loaded, the events remain. 

Additionally, there is color coding based on time of day. The text area will be gray for times in the past, red for the current hour, and green for hours in the future.
